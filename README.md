Models for deepfakes/faceswap

See https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap for the main repo
## Format
Models **must** be stored in zip format.

## Versioning
Add model tags as follows:
`v<major>.<minor>`
Where: 

`<major>` is the model identifier (should never change for different iterations of the same model).

`<minor>` is the version number of the model (start at version 1 and iterate for new versions).
